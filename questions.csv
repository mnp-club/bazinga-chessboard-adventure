Geometry,Easy,"Consider a triangle where the three cevians are concurrent. A quick note: a cevian is a line segment that joins a vertex of a triangle to a point on the opposite side, named after Giovanni Ceva, an Italian mathematician known for his contributions to elementary geometry, particularly Ceva's theorem. Let AD, CF, and BE be the three cevians. Given that CE = 2, EA = 3, AF = 5, BF = 2, BD = 3, find the ratio of area of triangle DEF to area of triangle ABC.","$15/64$"

Trivia,Easy," Let M be the midpoint of a chord PQ of a circle, through which two other chords AB and CD are drawn; AD and BC intersect chord PQ at X and Y correspondingly. Then M is the midpoint of XY. This theorem gets its name owing to the figure's resemblance to a living creature. ID the theorem","Butterfly Theorem"
Trivia,Hard,"\"We Must Know, We Will Know\" is marked on the gravestone of which German mathematician, who has a vector named after him in functional Analysis? The marking is a quote by himself to counter Emil du Bois-Reymond's quote \"ignoramus et ignorabimus\" meaning \"We do not know and we will not know\", to suggest scientific knowledge is limited, exactly opposite in respect to the mathematician's pursuit of pushing the boundaries of mathematics with a set of 23.","David Hilbert"
Trivia,Hard,"Neil Sloane started it as a graduate student in 1964 to support his work in combinatorics and ended up publishing two books.  As the size increased, he shifted his medium and ended up with the current form in 1996, with over 370,000 items (which still grows by approximately 30 daily). What am I talking about with categories such as cons, dead, dump, fini, nice, walk, etc ?","OEIS - Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences"
