Geometry,Easy,"Consider a triangle where the three cevians are concurrent. A quick note: a cevian is a line segment that joins a vertex of a triangle to a point on the opposite side, named after Giovanni Ceva, an Italian mathematician known for his contributions to elementary geometry, particularly Ceva's theorem. Let AD, CF, and BE be the three cevians. Given that CE = 2, EA = 3, AF = 5, BF = 2, BD = 3, find the ratio of area of triangle DEF to area of triangle ABC.","$\\frac{15}{64}$"

Trivia,Hard,"``We Must Know, We Will Know'' is marked on the gravestone of which German mathematician, who has a vector named after him in functional Analysis? The marking is a quote by himself to counter Emil du Bois-Reymond's quote ``ignoramus et ignorabimus'' meaning ``We do not know and we will not know'', to suggest scientific knowledge is limited, exactly opposite in respect to the mathematician's pursuit of pushing the boundaries of mathematics with a set of 23.","David Hilbert"
